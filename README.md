This repository contains code and figures for a numerical study of a Van der Pol–Duffing (VdPD) oscillator coupled to a Nonlinear Tuned Vibration Absorber (NLTVA). The project reproduces and extends the results of Habib & Kerschen (2015) on suppressing limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) using an optimally tuned passive nonlinear absorber. It implements the optimal tuning rules for the NLTVA, computes the maximum stabilizable negative damping, and compares uncontrolled and controlled responses through bifurcation diagrams and time‑domain simulations.
